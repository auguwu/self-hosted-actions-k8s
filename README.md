# Self Hosted Action Runners on Kubernetes
This repository is just a documentation of a journey on a question I had, and that question was:

> "Can I run self-hosted GitHub Action runners on Kubernetes?"

The results may shock you!

## WARNING
Please... for the love god don't do this unless you really want to like I wanted to.

## How did I get this thing running?
Since I haven't done anything yet, this will be later written out

## License
This is going under the unlicensed since I don't think I want to be the blame for wanting to do this.
